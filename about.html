                Hi..I'm ChandraKaran Reddy - student, passionate coder and self-learner aiming to pursue a career in Software Industry.
                <br><br>
                I was born and brought-up in Karimnagar. I had completed my schooling in 2016 and always dreamt of joining great universities for graduation during my intermediate.
                After all hard-work and struggles, I've managed to join <b>JNTU College Of Engineering Hyderabad</b>,Kukatpally.
                I've opted Computer Science as my engineering stream as I had passion for coding. It was a great time in graduation where I learnt a lot and met different people 
                with different mindsets.According to me, learning is a continous process if one really has thirst for knowledge.
                <br><br>
                Currently, I am working as an intern in <b>Zemoso Technologies</b>,Hyderabad. I started working in Zemoso since jan 3,2022.
